# 1MD020-Group10-Project

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the modules this project needs.
- You can have a glimpse at `examples.py` to view how currently this project works.
- In `detectors.py` defines the detectors, e.g. `QrCodeDector`... We might need to use different libraries, so it would be good to wrap them and have a same interface.
